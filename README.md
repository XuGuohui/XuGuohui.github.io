# Terms

All of the articles and gists here are input by myself word by word. Anyone can <b>NOT</b> copy these articles and gists or part of them to paste somewhere public, since I was suffering from the waste of time scrolling screen to filter out lots of duplicate searching result. I think every article on the internet should be unique, even though some of them are similar, but we can learn different opinions, not just click in and back return after seeing the totally the same words with only different format or layout. It's really a waste of time and annoying.
