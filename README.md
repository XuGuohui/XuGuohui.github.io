# Terms

Anyone can **NOT** copy and paste these articles and gists or part of them to somewhere public, since I was suffering from wasting time scrolling screen to filter out lots of duplicate searching result. I think every article on the internet should be unique, even though some of them are similar, but we can learn from different opinions, not just click in and back return after seeing the totally the same words with the only different format or layout. It's really a waste of time and annoying.
